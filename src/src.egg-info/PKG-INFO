# COMS W3132 Individual Project

## Author

## Project Title
Perfume Recommendation System Using Machine Learning!

## Project Description
The Perfume Recommendation System is designed to simplify the exploration of fragrances by providing personalized suggestions based on user preferences such as floral, woody, or citrus scents. Leveraging Python 3.7+ and machine learning technologies, this platform utilizes Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation, Matplotlib for visual analytics, and a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The system uses collaborative and content-based filtering techniques to aid both novices and perfume enthusiasts in discovering scents that match their preferences, enhancing the overall user experience.


## Timeline

*To track progress on the project, we will use the following intermediate milestones for your overall project. Each milestone will be marked with a tag in the git repository, and we will check progress and provide feedback at key milestones.*

| Date               | Milestone                                                                                              | Deliverables                | Git tag    |

## Requirements, Features and User Stories
**Hardware:**

A standard computer with internet access, capable of running Python and handling moderate computational tasks.

**Software:**

- **Python 3.7+**: Main programming language used for backend development.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Utilized for interactive development and testing, particularly useful for experimenting with data manipulation and visualization scripts.

**Installation:**
Install the necessary dependencies with the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Technical Specification

- **Data Handling**: Python with Pandas and NumPy for managing and analyzing data.
- **Machine Learning**: Collaborative and content-based filtering methods for generating recommendations.
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib for creating visual insights into the dataset and results.

**Libraries and Frameworks:**

- **Streamlit**: Used to create the user interface and deploy the interactive web application, allowing users to interactively explore perfume recommendations.
- **Pandas**: Employs its data structures and tools for efficient data manipulation and analysis, crucial for handling the perfume dataset.
- **Pickle**: Utilized for loading and saving pre-processed data and model state, ensuring that data persistence is managed efficiently.
- **os**: Provides functionalities to interact with the file system, ensuring robust file operations like checking for file existence.
- **scikit-learn (cosine_similarity)**: Facilitates the calculation of similarity scores between various perfumes based on their characteristics, supporting the recommendation logic in the backend.


## System or Software Architecture Diagram
*Include a block-based diagram illustrating the architecture of your software or system. This should include major components, such as user interface elements, back-end services, and data storage, and show how they interact. Tools like Lucidchart, Draw.io, or even hand-drawn diagrams photographed and uploaded are acceptable. The purpose of the diagram is to help us understand the architecture of your solution. Diagram asthetics do not matter and will not be graded.*

## Development Methodology
*Describe the methodology you'll use to organize and progress your work.*

*First, describe your plan for developing your project. This might include how (or if) you plan to use*
- *GitHub projects board to track progress on tasks and milestones*
- *GitHub issues to keep track of issues or problems*
- *Separate Git branches and/or GitHub pull requests for development*
- *GitHub actions for automated testing or deployment pipelines*
- *GitHub wiki for documentation and notes*

*Please also describe how (if) you plan test and evaluate your project's functionality. Do you plan to test manually or automatically? Any specific testing frameworks or libraries you plan to use?*

## Potential Challenges and Roadblocks
*Identify any potential challenges or roadblocks you anticipate facing during the development of your project. For each challenge, propose strategies or solutions you might use to overcome them, which may include getting help from the TAs/instructor. This could include technical hurdles or learning new technologies.*

## Additional Resources
*Include any additional resources, tutorials, or documentation that will be helpful for this project.*

## Conclusion and Future Work
In conclusion, this project aims to deliver a robust and user-friendly perfume recommendation system. Future enhancements may include expanding the dataset, integrating real-time user feedback, and exploring more advanced machine learning models to improve recommendation accuracy.
